Transitioning yet again from one platform to another—it is almost like someone collecting typewriters or exquisite pencils instead of actually writing—I’ve now settled, for the time being on a [Jekyll](1) site with some [Octopress](2a) sprinkles (just the [rake tasks](2b)) and, again for the time being, with a [Hyde](3) theme.

Next steps would be to import old entries from Movable Type (one of the reasons for choosing Jekyll is the handy [importer](4)), figure out how to open newly created posts in Vim (note to self: [must try](5) `system “vim #entry_name`). And maybe at some point, I’d actually get on with some writing too.
