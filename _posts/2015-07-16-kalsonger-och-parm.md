I've been thinking about packing light for over 30 years. Reducing the amount of things you need to bring with you in order to still be comfortable at your destination is a fine pursuit, and one that requires contemplation. 

When hiking or riding a bike for long distances over several days, weight matters even more then if you're carrying your stuff from city to city travelling in trains, planes and automobiles, but even then there's a freedom in not having to lug around things that'll only weigh you down.

The trick of reducing until all you're left with is the bare necessities is twofold: the obvious one is to remove what you really don't need, but the slightly less obvious is to add what you actually need. If you arrive at your destination and spend your time feeling uncomfortable you haven't packed right.

Several years ago, in 1984, I found my hero, the man who forever will epitomise what I aspire to when I start packing a bag for a long or short trip anywhere in the world. He arrived from a cross-continental 12 hour flight carrying nothing but a ring binder containing two or three plastic sleeves: one or two with the paperwork required to carry out his job (I think he was an electrical engineer), the remaining sleeve contained a pair of swimming trunks. Everything required to comfortably getting your stuff done, nothing whatsoever you didn't really need.
