Being faced with the slowness of an edge connection, ten times slower than the good-old dial-up modem, as happens every time we retire to the cottage in the woods, frustration first abounds. Thoughts of engineering huge home-made amplifying masts out of tin foil and coathangers, or hoisting the receiver up the flagpole which all Swedish houses come equipped with fills my mind, and I find it hard to concentrate.

It would feel better not using my computer knowing that my connection was fast.
