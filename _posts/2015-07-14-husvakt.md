The trouble with cats, lawns and general domestication is that it doesn't play particularly well with travelling, so when we decided to spend a few weeks away this summer I started looking for someone to look after the house, water the lawn and feed those pesky cats. My preferred method of looking is one the Buddha would approve of, consisting only of a general awareness that something would need to be done, so that you casually can swipe at the opportunity when it arises.

And so it was that when the Swedish east London Facebook group Y follows saw a post about a possible house-swap with a family from Sweden, I replied and said I didn't need to swap, but that there was a house here that needed someone to mind it.

The group conducts its business in Swedish, so Y was using the translate option to get more than a gist of the message, this is how we discovered a hidden little gem in the Facebook translation engine: the Swedish word for house-sitter "husvakt" auto-translated quite peculiarly, when I wrote "Det vore bra att ha husvakt" (it would be good to get a house-sitter), anyone using the translate button got the rather unorthodox translation "It would be good to get sex-tapes". 

I'm still not sure if they read the original or translated version, I guess time will tell.
