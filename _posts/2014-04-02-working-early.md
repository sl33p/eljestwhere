The silence and solitude of those first few hours before anyone else wakes up is one of the favourite things I can think of. Yet, I rarely put my alarm on super early, and when I do, I snooze and snooze again. I wonder whether part of the magic is that I experience it rarely. 

One day, and it might be soon, Iâ€™ll do a week of getting up an hour and a half earlier than normal, around the time I imagine you have to get up if you have cows to milk. After a few days I might re-evaluate my list of favourite things, or I might have forced myself to a few extra hours of contentment. Coming to think of it, these early hours might not even have to be about work, they could be about writing, drinking coffee, going for bike rides as the sun goes up. I might even start tomorrow.
