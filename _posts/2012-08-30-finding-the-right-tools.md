Title: Finding The Right Tools
---

The flakiness, especial of the first solution I tried, an installation of Monologue running on Heroku, made me search for something with a little less friction, something that would allow me to just store some text files somewhere and getting them to automatically publish to the web. Today, I'm trying scriptogr.am, a hosted service which syncs with Dropbox. The nice thing about this option is that it — in theory — would allow me to concentrate on the writing aspect, rather than procrastinating in the tool-shed. And, if scriptogr.am, or even Dropbox closes shop, or falls out of fashion, I'll still have a bunch of text files only computer. Currently I'm using Mou to edit the Markdown files, primarily as it has a nifty keyboard shortcut for publishing.

At the moment, this feels somewhat like just what the doctor ordered, but I can't shake the feeling that I should be rolling something of my own. Let's keep on writing for a few days and find out what that might be.
