This morning I took a detour to work as I was attempting to get Y's birthday watch repaired, but I forgot that the repair shop is closed on Mondays. On the way back from Clerkenwell I decided to take the leisurely Regent's Canal route, as it was raining the path was mostly empty, some old ladies with small dogs, the odd jogger, a bike now and then. 

As I was passing under one of the bridges, thinking about how I really should get a bell, a woman on a bike turned round the corner onto the stretch of path under the bridge, clipped the side of her handlebars on my bike, and proceeded to fall very slowly straight into the canal. 

I pulled the woman and her bicycle out of the water and asked with great concern if everything was ok. Fine, she said. "It's a London baptism. I have biked this route for 11 years, it was bound to happen sooner or later".
