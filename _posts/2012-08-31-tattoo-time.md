title: Tattoo Time
---

In 1995 I stopped getting tattoos. I can't quite remember why anymore, I wasn't even finished, there are outline on my ribcage still not filled in, and the plan, which always was a half-body suit, was abandoned.

I suppose I just moved on and found something else to do with my time. I always knew, however, that I'd continue getting tattoos after turning 40. This was a magical break-point, when working as the floor-sweeper in the tattooist I saw the evidence: People getting tattoos were either under 25, over 40, or recovering alcoholics.

Finding my way back into a scene that I once was very familiar with is proving difficult, however. I don't have the language anymore. I don't know the names of either the artists or the styles, and finding a common and credible langauge in which to communicate with the prospective craftsperson is daunting.

It is, in a nutshell, no different from the  client-designer relationship we – as designers – deal with every day. My conclusions so far, after having actively involved myself in talking to tattooists and conducting research for a couple of days, is:

1. It shouldn't be necessary for a client to  know all the terms and having all the ideas worked out already. The terminology is important for internal communication, as it affords precision and acts as a shorthand. It should not be a necessary requirement for anyone else.

2. Ideas from the client should ideally be embryonic. Knowing what you're trying to achieve is essential, it is, however, the job of the craftsperson to interpret the wishes, translate these into something aesthetic, functioning and tangible. Otherwise you're just a pair of hands.

So far, I have not found who I'm looking for. Someone who's willing to listen, and take ownership of the ideas and make these into something that is both an expression of their skills, artistry and tone of voice, and a product of the narrative the conversation and ideas borne.
