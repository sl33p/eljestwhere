title: Write Every Day

<!--  2012-08-20 -->
One of the greatest achievments with the first incarnation of this site was that it was written nearly every day. Retaining this goal and keeping the determination to get something down on paper at least once every day is the only way I can see myself keeping an interest.

The first couple of posts are inevitably meta, creating a mission statement of sorts. After this initial period we should be back to reflections on life, not seeking sensation or excitement, but a level of consistent minuscule insights building up to something larger than the sum of its parts. It will take 10 years to mature, no doubt.
