   <title>Kalsonger och Pärm</title>
   <link href="http://eljestwhere.org/2015/07/16/kalsonger-och-parm/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-16T08:02:00+01:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about packing light for over 30 years. Reducing the amount of things you need to bring with you in order to still be comfortable at your destination is a fine pursuit, and one that requires contemplation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hiking or riding a bike for long distances over several days, weight matters even more then if you&amp;#39;re carrying your stuff from city to city travelling in trains, planes and automobiles, but even then there&amp;#39;s a freedom in not having to lug around things that&amp;#39;ll only weigh you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick of reducing until all you&amp;#39;re left with is the bare necessities is twofold: the obvious one is to remove what you really don&amp;#39;t need, but the slightly less obvious is to add what you actually need. If you arrive at your destination and spend your time feeling uncomfortable you haven&amp;#39;t packed right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, in 1984, I found my hero, the man who forever will epitomise what I aspire to when I start packing a bag for a long or short trip anywhere in the world. He arrived from a cross-continental 12 hour flight carrying nothing but a ring binder containing two or three plastic sleeves: one or two with the paperwork required to carry out his job (I think he was an electrical engineer), the remaining sleeve contained a pair of swimming trunks. Everything required to comfortably getting your stuff done, nothing whatsoever you didn&amp;#39;t really need.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>husvakt</title>

   <id>http://eljestwhere.org/2015/07/14/husvakt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The trouble with cats, lawns and general domestication is that it doesn&amp;#39;t play particularly well with travelling, so when we decided to spend a few weeks away this summer I started looking for someone to look after the house, water the lawn and feed those pesky cats. My preferred method of looking is one the Buddha would approve of, consisting only of a general awareness that something would need to be done, so that you casually can swipe at the opportunity when it arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it was that when the Swedish east London Facebook group Y follows saw a post about a possible house-swap with a family from Sweden, I replied and said I didn&amp;#39;t need to swap, but that there was a house here that needed someone to mind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group conducts its business in Swedish, so Y was using the translate option to get more than a gist of the message, this is how we discovered a hidden little gem in the Facebook translation engine: the Swedish word for house-sitter &amp;quot;husvakt&amp;quot; auto-translated quite peculiarly, when I wrote &amp;quot;Det vore bra att ha husvakt&amp;quot; (it would be good to get a house-sitter), anyone using the translate button got the rather unorthodox translation &amp;quot;It would be good to get sex-tapes&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still not sure if they read the original or translated version, I guess time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Canal adventure</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning I took a detour to work as I was attempting to get Y&amp;#39;s birthday watch repaired, but I forgot that the repair shop is closed on Mondays. On the way back from Clerkenwell I decided to take the leisurely Regent&amp;#39;s Canal route, as it was raining the path was mostly empty, some old ladies with small dogs, the odd jogger, a bike now and then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was passing under one of the bridges, thinking about how I really should get a bell, a woman on a bike turned round the corner onto the stretch of path under the bridge, clipped the side of her handlebars on my bike, and proceeded to fall very slowly straight into the canal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled the woman and her bicycle out of the water and asked with great concern if everything was ok. Fine, she said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a London baptism. I have biked this route for 11 years, it was bound to happen sooner or later&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Waking early</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The silence and solitude of those first few hours before anyone else wakes up is one of the favourite things I can think of. Yet, I rarely put my alarm on super early, and when I do, I snooze and snooze again. I wonder whether part of the magic is that I experience it rarely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, and it might be soon, I’ll do a week of getting up an hour and a half earlier than normal, around the time I imagine you have to get up if you have cows to milk. After a few days I might re-evaluate my list of favourite things, or I might have forced myself to a few extra hours of contentment. Coming to think of it, these early hours might not even have to be about work, they could be about writing, drinking coffee, going for bike rides as the sun goes up. I might even start tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://eljestwhere.org/2014/03/28/freaky-friday</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Transitioning yet again from one platform to another—it is almost like someone collecting typewriters or exquisite pencils instead of actually writing—I’ve now settled, for the time being on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; site with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org&quot;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; sprinkles (just the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/Rakefile&quot;&gt;rake tasks&lt;/a&gt;) and, again for the time being, with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/hyde&quot;&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps would be to import old entries from Movable Type (one of the reasons for choosing Jekyll is the handy &lt;a href=&quot;http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/mt/&quot;&gt;importer&lt;/a&gt;), figure out how to open newly created posts in Vim (note to self: &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11021456/open-vim-from-a-rakefile&quot;&gt;must try&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;system “vim #entry_name&lt;/code&gt;). And maybe at some point, I’d actually get on with some writing too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tattoo Time</title>
   <link href="http://eljestwhere.org/2012/08/31/tattoo-time/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://eljestwhere.org/2012/08/31/tattoo-time</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1995 I stopped getting tattoos. I can&amp;#39;t quite remember why anymore, I wasn&amp;#39;t even finished, there are outline on my ribcage still not filled in, and the plan, which always was a half-body suit, was abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I just moved on and found something else to do with my time. I always knew, however, that I&amp;#39;d continue getting tattoos after turning 40. This was a magical break-point, when working as the floor-sweeper in the tattooist I saw the evidence: People getting tattoos were either under 25, over 40, or recovering alcoholics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding my way back into a scene that I once was very familiar with is proving difficult, however. I don&amp;#39;t have the language anymore. I don&amp;#39;t know the names of either the artists or the styles, and finding a common and credible langauge in which to communicate with the prospective craftsperson is daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, in a nutshell, no different from the  client-designer relationship we – as designers – deal with every day. My conclusions so far, after having actively involved myself in talking to tattooists and conducting research for a couple of days, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shouldn&amp;#39;t be necessary for a client to  know all the terms and having all the ideas worked out already. The terminology is important for internal communication, as it affords precision and acts as a shorthand. It should not be a necessary requirement for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideas from the client should ideally be embryonic. Knowing what you&amp;#39;re trying to achieve is essential, it is, however, the job of the craftsperson to interpret the wishes, translate these into something aesthetic, functioning and tangible. Otherwise you&amp;#39;re just a pair of hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have not found who I&amp;#39;m looking for. Someone who&amp;#39;s willing to listen, and take ownership of the ideas and make these into something that is both an expression of their skills, artistry and tone of voice, and a product of the narrative the conversation and ideas borne.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Finding The Right Tools</title>

   <id>http://eljestwhere.org/2012/08/30/finding-the-right-tools</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The flakiness, especial of the first solution I tried, an installation of Monologue running on Heroku, made me search for something with a little less friction, something that would allow me to just store some text files somewhere and getting them to automatically publish to the web. Today, I&amp;#39;m trying scriptogr.am, a hosted service which syncs with Dropbox. The nice thing about this option is that it — in theory — would allow me to concentrate on the writing aspect, rather than procrastinating in the tool-shed. And, if scriptogr.am, or even Dropbox closes shop, or falls out of fashion, I&amp;#39;ll still have a bunch of text files only computer. Currently I&amp;#39;m using Mou to edit the Markdown files, primarily as it has a nifty keyboard shortcut for publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, this feels somewhat like just what the doctor ordered, but I can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling that I should be rolling something of my own. Let&amp;#39;s keep on writing for a few days and find out what that might be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;⬆1.15 KB/S ⬇9.4KB/S&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being faced with the slowness of an edge connection, ten times slower than the good-old dial-up modem, as happens every time we retire to the cottage in the woods, frustration first abounds. Thoughts of engineering huge home-made amplifying masts out of tin foil and coathangers, or hoisting the receiver up the flagpole which all Swedish houses come equipped with fills my mind, and I find it hard to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would feel better not using my computer knowing that my connection was fast.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago when this weblog started, one of the first things I posted was a link to this page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disturbingauctions.com/view.php?item=51&quot;&gt;http://www.disturbingauctions.com/view.php?item=51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding out that the site is still around is a great as most of the links accumulated over the years now are dead, leading to badly considered 404s, giving little idea of the original topography of the place. But that&amp;#39;s another story, and one which Jeremy Keith tells much better. But I digress—greater still is finding out that this long-standing favourite is the brainchild of none other than Panic&amp;#39;s Steven Frank. Hey, I know who that guy is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could talk about how the web was a smaller place back then, but I could also discuss how Twitter and the likes has given us the opportunity to feel like we know the people who makes our FTP clients, but I&amp;#39;m not sure that it is hitting the spot, not sure that the feeling that I had on rediscovering the drunken monkey can be explained our captured in theorising about the way we socialise and build communities online. There is something interesting, however, in the fact that 10 years ago, in a much smaller place then what we have now, I knew less about the people around me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;!--  2012-08-20 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest achievments with the first incarnation of this site was that it was written nearly every day. Retaining this goal and keeping the determination to get something down on paper at least once every day is the only way I can see myself keeping an interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first couple of posts are inevitably meta, creating a mission statement of sorts. After this initial period we should be back to reflections on life, not seeking sensation or excitement, but a level of consistent minuscule insights building up to something larger than the sum of its parts. It will take 10 years to mature, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I discovered that eljestwhere.org had fallen out of the hands of the spammer who registered the site after i neglected to renew it back in the day (when? a long time ago). Since I had $9.95 I re-registered it and thought that maybe I should start writing again. This is the first post. Hello world.&lt;/p&gt;
