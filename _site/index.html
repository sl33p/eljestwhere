    <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about packing light for over 30 years. Reducing the amount of things you need to bring with you in order to still be comfortable at your destination is a fine pursuit, and one that requires contemplation. </p>

<p>When hiking or riding a bike for long distances over several days, weight matters even more then if you&#39;re carrying your stuff from city to city travelling in trains, planes and automobiles, but even then there&#39;s a freedom in not having to lug around things that&#39;ll only weigh you down.</p>

<p>The trick of reducing until all you&#39;re left with is the bare necessities is twofold: the obvious one is to remove what you really don&#39;t need, but the slightly less obvious is to add what you actually need. If you arrive at your destination and spend your time feeling uncomfortable you haven&#39;t packed right.</p>

<p>Several years ago, in 1984, I found my hero, the man who forever will epitomise what I aspire to when I start packing a bag for a long or short trip anywhere in the world. He arrived from a cross-continental 12 hour flight carrying nothing but a ring binder containing two or three plastic sleeves: one or two with the paperwork required to carry out his job (I think he was an electrical engineer), the remaining sleeve contained a pair of swimming trunks. Everything required to comfortably getting your stuff done, nothing whatsoever you didn&#39;t really need.</p>

    <p>The trouble with cats, lawns and general domestication is that it doesn&#39;t play particularly well with travelling, so when we decided to spend a few weeks away this summer I started looking for someone to look after the house, water the lawn and feed those pesky cats. My preferred method of looking is one the Buddha would approve of, consisting only of a general awareness that something would need to be done, so that you casually can swipe at the opportunity when it arises.</p>

<p>And so it was that when the Swedish east London Facebook group Y follows saw a post about a possible house-swap with a family from Sweden, I replied and said I didn&#39;t need to swap, but that there was a house here that needed someone to mind it.</p>

<p>The group conducts its business in Swedish, so Y was using the translate option to get more than a gist of the message, this is how we discovered a hidden little gem in the Facebook translation engine: the Swedish word for house-sitter &quot;husvakt&quot; auto-translated quite peculiarly, when I wrote &quot;Det vore bra att ha husvakt&quot; (it would be good to get a house-sitter), anyone using the translate button got the rather unorthodox translation &quot;It would be good to get sex-tapes&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still not sure if they read the original or translated version, I guess time will tell.</p>

    <p>This morning I took a detour to work as I was attempting to get Y&#39;s birthday watch repaired, but I forgot that the repair shop is closed on Mondays. On the way back from Clerkenwell I decided to take the leisurely Regent&#39;s Canal route, as it was raining the path was mostly empty, some old ladies with small dogs, the odd jogger, a bike now and then. </p>

<p>As I was passing under one of the bridges, thinking about how I really should get a bell, a woman on a bike turned round the corner onto the stretch of path under the bridge, clipped the side of her handlebars on my bike, and proceeded to fall very slowly straight into the canal. </p>

<p>I pulled the woman and her bicycle out of the water and asked with great concern if everything was ok. Fine, she said. &quot;It&#39;s a London baptism. I have biked this route for 11 years, it was bound to happen sooner or later&quot;. </p>

    <p>The silence and solitude of those first few hours before anyone else wakes up is one of the favourite things I can think of. Yet, I rarely put my alarm on super early, and when I do, I snooze and snooze again. I wonder whether part of the magic is that I experience it rarely. </p>

<p>One day, and it might be soon, I’ll do a week of getting up an hour and a half earlier than normal, around the time I imagine you have to get up if you have cows to milk. After a few days I might re-evaluate my list of favourite things, or I might have forced myself to a few extra hours of contentment. Coming to think of it, these early hours might not even have to be about work, they could be about writing, drinking coffee, going for bike rides as the sun goes up. I might even start tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Transitioning yet again from one platform to another—it is almost like someone collecting typewriters or exquisite pencils instead of actually writing—I’ve now settled, for the time being on a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> site with some <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> sprinkles (just the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/Rakefile">rake tasks</a>) and, again for the time being, with a <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a> theme.</p>

<p>Next steps would be to import old entries from Movable Type (one of the reasons for choosing Jekyll is the handy <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/mt/">importer</a>), figure out how to open newly created posts in Vim (note to self: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11021456/open-vim-from-a-rakefile">must try</a> <code>system “vim #entry_name</code>). And maybe at some point, I’d actually get on with some writing too.</p>
