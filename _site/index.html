        “Waking early"

    <p>The silence and solitude of those first few hours before anyone else wakes up is one of the favourite things I can think of. Yet, I rarely put my alarm on super early, and when I do, I snooze and snooze again. I wonder whether part of the magic is that I experience it rarely. </p>

<p>One day, and it might be soon, I’ll do a week of getting up an hour and a half earlier than normal, around the time I imagine you have to get up if you have cows to milk. After a few days I might re-evaluate my list of favourite things, or I might have forced myself to a few extra hours of contentment. Coming to think of it, these early hours might not even have to be about work, they could be about writing, drinking coffee, going for bike rides as the sun goes up. I might even start tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Transitioning yet again from one platform to another—it is almost like someone collecting typewriters or exquisite pencils instead of actually writing—I’ve now settled, for the time being on a <a href="1">Jekyll</a> site with some <a href="2a">Octopress</a> sprinkles (just the <a href="2b">rake tasks</a>) and, again for the time being, with a <a href="3">Hyde</a> theme.</p>

<p>Next steps would be to import old entries from Movable Type (one of the reasons for choosing Jekyll is the handy <a href="4">importer</a>), figure out how to open newly created posts in Vim (note to self: <a href="5">must try</a> <code>system “vim #entry_name</code>). And maybe at some point, I’d actually get on with some writing too.</p>

        Tattoo Time
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>In 1995 I stopped getting tattoos. I can&#39;t quite remember why anymore, I wasn&#39;t even finished, there are outline on my ribcage still not filled in, and the plan, which always was a half-body suit, was abandoned.</p>

<p>I suppose I just moved on and found something else to do with my time. I always knew, however, that I&#39;d continue getting tattoos after turning 40. This was a magical break-point, when working as the floor-sweeper in the tattooist I saw the evidence: People getting tattoos were either under 25, over 40, or recovering alcoholics.</p>

<p>Finding my way back into a scene that I once was very familiar with is proving difficult, however. I don&#39;t have the language anymore. I don&#39;t know the names of either the artists or the styles, and finding a common and credible langauge in which to communicate with the prospective craftsperson is daunting.</p>

<p>It is, in a nutshell, no different from the  client-designer relationship we – as designers – deal with every day. My conclusions so far, after having actively involved myself in talking to tattooists and conducting research for a couple of days, is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It shouldn&#39;t be necessary for a client to  know all the terms and having all the ideas worked out already. The terminology is important for internal communication, as it affords precision and acts as a shorthand. It should not be a necessary requirement for anyone else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideas from the client should ideally be embryonic. Knowing what you&#39;re trying to achieve is essential, it is, however, the job of the craftsperson to interpret the wishes, translate these into something aesthetic, functioning and tangible. Otherwise you&#39;re just a pair of hands.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far, I have not found who I&#39;m looking for. Someone who&#39;s willing to listen, and take ownership of the ideas and make these into something that is both an expression of their skills, artistry and tone of voice, and a product of the narrative the conversation and ideas borne.</p>

        Finding The Right Tools

    <p>The flakiness, especial of the first solution I tried, an installation of Monologue running on Heroku, made me search for something with a little less friction, something that would allow me to just store some text files somewhere and getting them to automatically publish to the web. Today, I&#39;m trying scriptogr.am, a hosted service which syncs with Dropbox. The nice thing about this option is that it — in theory — would allow me to concentrate on the writing aspect, rather than procrastinating in the tool-shed. And, if scriptogr.am, or even Dropbox closes shop, or falls out of fashion, I&#39;ll still have a bunch of text files only computer. Currently I&#39;m using Mou to edit the Markdown files, primarily as it has a nifty keyboard shortcut for publishing.</p>

<p>At the moment, this feels somewhat like just what the doctor ordered, but I can&#39;t shake the feeling that I should be rolling something of my own. Let&#39;s keep on writing for a few days and find out what that might be.</p>

<p>Being faced with the slowness of an edge connection, ten times slower than the good-old dial-up modem, as happens every time we retire to the cottage in the woods, frustration first abounds. Thoughts of engineering huge home-made amplifying masts out of tin foil and coathangers, or hoisting the receiver up the flagpole which all Swedish houses come equipped with fills my mind, and I find it hard to concentrate.</p>

<p>It would feel better not using my computer knowing that my connection was fast.</p>
