  <p>Ten years ago when this weblog started, one of the first things I posted was a link to this page: <a href="http://www.disturbingauctions.com/view.php?item=51">http://www.disturbingauctions.com/view.php?item=51</a></p>

<p>Finding out that the site is still around is a great as most of the links accumulated over the years now are dead, leading to badly considered 404s, giving little idea of the original topography of the place. But that&#39;s another story, and one which Jeremy Keith tells much better. But I digress—greater still is finding out that this long-standing favourite is the brainchild of none other than Panic&#39;s Steven Frank. Hey, I know who that guy is!</p>

<p>I could talk about how the web was a smaller place back then, but I could also discuss how Twitter and the likes has given us the opportunity to feel like we know the people who makes our FTP clients, but I&#39;m not sure that it is hitting the spot, not sure that the feeling that I had on rediscovering the drunken monkey can be explained our captured in theorising about the way we socialise and build communities online. There is something interesting, however, in the fact that 10 years ago, in a much smaller place then what we have now, I knew less about the people around me.</p>
