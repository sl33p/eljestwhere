  <h1 class="post-title">Tattoo Time</h1>
  <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2012</span>
  <p>In 1995 I stopped getting tattoos. I can&#39;t quite remember why anymore, I wasn&#39;t even finished, there are outline on my ribcage still not filled in, and the plan, which always was a half-body suit, was abandoned.</p>

<p>I suppose I just moved on and found something else to do with my time. I always knew, however, that I&#39;d continue getting tattoos after turning 40. This was a magical break-point, when working as the floor-sweeper in the tattooist I saw the evidence: People getting tattoos were either under 25, over 40, or recovering alcoholics.</p>

<p>Finding my way back into a scene that I once was very familiar with is proving difficult, however. I don&#39;t have the language anymore. I don&#39;t know the names of either the artists or the styles, and finding a common and credible langauge in which to communicate with the prospective craftsperson is daunting.</p>

<p>It is, in a nutshell, no different from the  client-designer relationship we – as designers – deal with every day. My conclusions so far, after having actively involved myself in talking to tattooists and conducting research for a couple of days, is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It shouldn&#39;t be necessary for a client to  know all the terms and having all the ideas worked out already. The terminology is important for internal communication, as it affords precision and acts as a shorthand. It should not be a necessary requirement for anyone else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideas from the client should ideally be embryonic. Knowing what you&#39;re trying to achieve is essential, it is, however, the job of the craftsperson to interpret the wishes, translate these into something aesthetic, functioning and tangible. Otherwise you&#39;re just a pair of hands.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far, I have not found who I&#39;m looking for. Someone who&#39;s willing to listen, and take ownership of the ideas and make these into something that is both an expression of their skills, artistry and tone of voice, and a product of the narrative the conversation and ideas borne.</p>
